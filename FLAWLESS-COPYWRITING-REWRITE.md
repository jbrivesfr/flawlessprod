> Your dedicated social media manager and client relationship expert.

### Lucy's Meta Strategy Expertise

**BEFORE:**
> Lucy excels at finding your "meta" - the intersection between your business, what people are talking about right now, and what your audience needs. For example: *Cybersecurity business + AI concerns = "Worried about AI security risks? We've got you covered."* Lucy identifies trends, fears, and needs in your industry and creates relatable, engaging content.

**AFTER:**
> Here's the problem: you're posting about your product. Nobody cares about your product.
> 
> They care about their problems.
> 
> Lucy finds the intersection between what you sell, what's trending, and what your audience is scared of or obsessed with. That's the "meta."
> 
> **Example:** You sell cybersecurity. Everyone's freaking out about AI hacks. Lucy's post: "Worried AI is coming for your data? Here's how we're stopping it."
> 
> That's content that converts. Not "Check out our new firewall features."

## GENERAL TONE SHIFTS

### Remove:
- "Professionally managed" (sounds corporate)
- "Enhanced agents for modern business" (vague, corporate)
- "Transform your workflow" (buzzword hell)

### Add More Of:
- "Stop doing X" (direct problem callout)
- "Here's what's broken" (diagnosis)
- "We fix it" (solution)
- Contrast statements (not X, but Y)
- Real examples over vague promises

### Edginess Without Being Aggressive:
- Call out the problem directly (you're wasting time)
- Use "you" language (conversational, direct)
- Avoid hedging ("sort of", "kind of", "helps you")
- Be declarative ("Lucy fixes that" not "Lucy can help you optimize")
- Add personality (no HR-approved corporate speak)

---

## SPECIFIC MICRO-EDITS

### Contact Form

**BEFORE:**
> WhatsApp contact provided after booking.

**AFTER:**
> We'll send you our WhatsApp after you book. Real humans respond.

---

### Footer Tagline

**BEFORE:**
> Enhanced Agents for Modern Business.

**AFTER:**
> Virtual teams that actually work.

## QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

1. **Are we selling to solopreneurs or small businesses?**
   - If solopreneurs: lean into "you're doing too much"
   - If small businesses: lean into "your team is burning out"

2. **How technical can we get?**
   - Current copy avoids "AI" mostly—intentional?
   - "Enhanced agents" is softer than "AI assistants"

3. **Price positioning:**
   - $1K/month is positioned as affordable—is that the angle?
   - Or premium but worth it?

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Review these rewrites
2. Tell me which tone hits right
3. I'll create final copy for implementation
4. Optional: A/B test hero sections to see what converts

---

**Bottom line:** Current copy is safe and professional. This rewrite is direct, problem-focused, and has personality. It's edgier without being obnoxious. Let me know what needs tweaking!
